# hw4_Quiz_Master

I put together an object for questions and answers

I put build a timer using set inverval to begin when I hit start, 
count down and turn the background red when it hit zero.

Learned about and used the spread operator to break up or spread out the elements in my object.

Used math dot random to select random questions

Learned about and used the splice method to remove questions from the object once they have been used so as not to repeat.  

was able to populate the questions on the buttons, 

I also was able to console.log true and false to get the right and wrong answers. 

I think I spent to much time learning new methods and operators that I lost sight of the project it self I got stuck on trying to intrement the score and ran out of time.  

Our teacher told us no matter what turn in anything even if you get stuck so I wanted to get something in to you all to see my progress.
